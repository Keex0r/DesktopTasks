# DesktopTasks
Displays a list of tasks, sorted by time remaining, as a desktop wallpaper.
The wallpaper is adjusted in regular intervals.

The idea is, that the desktop is a place you often glance over while working,
which makes it the prime location to display stuff you shouldn't forget.

The interface of the program is simple. It displays the list of created tasks,
lets you create a new task at a given date and time. You can delete tasks by
removing them from the list.
